; though the results of the project is adaptable to nearly every SDG.

## Mobile App/FourGifts

This folder contains all the source code for the prototype native Android app.

The design for the app was produced based on the interactive wireframe accessible at the following link: https://www.figma.com/file/35mvi9xPlDawH3Mpl7ibDo/Purpose?node-id=9248%3A0

## network.py, charities.txt, charities.xlsx

The Python script, network.py, keeps track of the user's previous donations to determine the best four charity projects to display.

The files, charities.txt and charities.xlsx, act as a data set to help the onboarding and validation of charities onto the app.
