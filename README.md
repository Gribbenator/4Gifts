## Mobile App/FourGifts

This folder contains all the source code for the prototype native Android app.

The design for the app was produced based on the interactive wireframe accessible at the following link: https://www.figma.com/file/35mvi9xPlDawH3Mpl7ibDo/Purpose?node-id=9248%3A0

## network.py, charities.txt, charities.xlsx

The Python script, network.py, is a neural network that tracks a user's previous donations to determine the best four projects to display to a user in order to optimise user engagement and increase donations.

The files, charities.txt and charities.xlsx, are a data set to help with the onboarding and validation of charities onto the app.
